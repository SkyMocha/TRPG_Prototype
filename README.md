# TRPG_Prototype
Tactical RPG prototype in Unity inspired by games like XCOM & Shadowrun

My first foray into pixel art! :)

Demos of the project can be found on my website [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/TRPG_Prototype/)

## Current functionality
* Movement & basic path-finding using A*
* Initiative based turn order
* Enemy spawning & clustering
* Enemy discovery
* Simple sprites for enemies & players
* Game logs

## Half-functional / In-progress
* Game map & collision 
* Enemy AI
* Shooting & actions

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)
